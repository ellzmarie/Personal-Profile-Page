# Personal Profile Page
 In this project, I’ll be practicing my web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile. I’ll modify the code for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text, and a stylish design. I’ll also be practicing HTML and CSS skills giving me a web page I can use to advertise my experience, skills, and goals.
